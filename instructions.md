# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Review the [Good README guide](../../01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/Good-README-Guide/README.md) as a reminder of everything that a quality, professional README contains. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```

Because this is a command-line application that won‚Äôt be deployed, you‚Äôll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of your application. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer.

## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of your project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Minimum Application Requirements

* Meets [Submission Requirements](#submission-requirements) in the following section.

* Functional application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

* The generated README includes the following sections: 

  * Title
  * Description
  * Table of Contents
  * Installation
  * Usage
  * License
  * Contributing
  * Tests
  * Questions

* The generated README includes 1 badge that's specific to the repository.


## Submission Requirements

Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You should include a link to the video in your application's `README.md` file.

* Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/`.

* `node_modules` is not tracked and uploaded to GitHub. (Hint: It is easy if you create your `.gitignore` file before installing dependencies with npm.)

* Repo **MUST** include `package.json` with required dependencies. (Hint: Run `npm init` when you first setup the project before installing any dependencies.)

* Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.

* Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have more than 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application. 

* A sample README.md file for a project repository generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.

# Your Project Title

## Description 

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile‚Äîand one that many new developers often overlook‚Äîis the README.md file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.



## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
